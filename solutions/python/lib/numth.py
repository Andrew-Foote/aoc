	# ax = b (mod m) is equivalent to x = rb (mod m), and so rb is the unique
	# solution.
	#
	# Otherwise, the extended Euclidean algorithm can still be used to compute
	# d = gcd(a, m). If d != 0 it will also give us a' = a / d, m' = m / d.
	# In the exceptional case where d = 0, we have a = m = 0, and "modulo 0"

	# (mod 0) as equivalent to the condition that 0 = q0 + b for some integer q,
	# i.e. 0 = b. So in this case, we can say that the solution set is the set
	# of all integers if b = 0, and the empty set otherwise.
	#
	# Now, ax = b (mod m) holds iff ax = qm + b, for some integer q, and given
	# a' = a / d and m' = m / d, we can rewrite this equation as
	# a'dx = qm'd + b, or equivalently (a'x - qm')d = b. From this we see that
